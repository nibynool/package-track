# NibyNool Package Track

This is my first Serverless Framework application.  It is primarily a learning piece to
understand how Serverless Framework can be used, to better understand how AWS serverless
services operate and to update my skills in Javascript.

No part of this package is ready for use, and no release date has been planned.  When it
is in a usable state code will be merged to the master branch.
